The application will also interact with various third-party APIs, such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, Last.fm, YouTube, and MusicBrainz, to fetch music-related data. Please make all answers as descriptive as possible, and when providing code, give the full context in your responses.
